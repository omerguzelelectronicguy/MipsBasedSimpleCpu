# MipsBasedSimpleCpu
This work is just to understand to design of a cpu.  It has single cycle 16-bit MiPS based architecture.
All the work is done in Vivado by Verilog.
This work may include mistakes and misunderstanding points about mips!!! but it should be a simple example to play. 
You are always welcome to suggest fixations.
